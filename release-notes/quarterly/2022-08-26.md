title: 22.8.0 ‘Carme’ released
tags: [carme]

Carme is the latest entry in our quarterly rollup series. It branches off from our main rolling Voyager development, into a fixed target for our partners to qualify and build upon.

Comet 22.8 "Carme" takes its name from another moon of Jupiter. It was discovered along with our previous Comet release "Lysithea" by Seth Barnes Nicholson in 1938, and both discoveries were reported in the very same publication. Despite sharing a discovery event, Lysithea is part of the "Himalian group" of moons, and Carme leads up the "Carme group" of moons. The moon itself is named after the Cretan goddess Carme, one of Zeus' lovers.

Carme brings 7 features and 14 enhancements, including IDrive e2 support, presigned clients, stochastic job delays, custom SMTP servers for Tenants, support for fallback domain controllers, more restore options, and improved performance.

As always for a new quarterly release, there are two changelogs for 22.8.0 "Carme" depending on whether you are coming from the previous quarterly release or the previous Voyager release.
